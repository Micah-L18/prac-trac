- **Review Phase**: Rich data analysis and note-taking capabilities

#### **Secondary Use Case: Practice Planning**
```
Template Selection ‚Üí Drill Customization ‚Üí Timeline Adjustment ‚Üí Save & Schedule
```

**Design Implications:**
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Visual practice building with immediate feedback
- **Template System**: Quick starts for common practice structures
- **Duration Visualization**: Real-time practice timing and flow preview

### üé® **Visual Hierarchy for Coaching**

#### **Information Priority Levels**
1. **Critical (Immediate Action Required)**
   - Timer displays, phase transitions, emergency controls
   - Size: Large (32px+ text), High contrast, Orange accent
   - Position: Center screen, always visible

## Interaction Design Principles

### ‚ö° **Speed & Efficiency**

#### **One-Tap Philosophy**
- **Primary Actions**: Always accessible in one tap from main screens
- **Secondary Actions**: Maximum two taps for any coaching function
- **Tertiary Actions**: Three taps maximum for administrative tasks

#### **Gesture Optimization**
```
Tap: Primary actions (start timer, log stat, select player)
Long Press: Context menus and detailed information
Swipe: Quick navigation between phases/drills
Pinch: Zoom for detailed view (video analysis, large text)
```

#### **Touch Target Standards**
- **Minimum Size**: 44x44px for all interactive elements
- **Coaching Mode**: 60x60px minimum for live practice actions
- **Emergency Controls**: 80x80px for critical functions (stop practice, emergency)

### üéØ **Precision & Confidence**

#### **Feedback Patterns**
```css
/* Immediate Feedback */
Button Press: 
- Visual: Orange border highlight + slight scale
- Haptic: Light impact feedback
- Audio: Subtle confirmation sound (optional)

/* Progress Indication */
Loading States:
- Visual: Orange progress bar with glass backdrop
- Text: Clear action description "Saving practice data..."
- Timeout: Maximum 3 seconds for any operation

/* Error Recovery */
Error States:
- Visual: Red accent with clear explanation
- Action: Immediate retry option + alternative path
- Prevention: Input validation before submission
```

#### **Confirmation Strategies**
- **Non-Destructive Actions**: No confirmation needed (save, log stat)
- **Potentially Disruptive**: Single confirmation (end practice early)
- **Destructive Actions**: Double confirmation with delay (delete player, reset data)

### üß† **Cognitive Load Reduction**

#### **Mental Model Alignment**
- **Real-World Metaphors**: Timer looks like stopwatch, roster like clipboard
- **Consistent Patterns**: Same action types always work the same way
- **Spatial Consistency**: Critical functions always in same screen positions

#### **Information Architecture**
```
